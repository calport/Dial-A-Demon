// Day 4 Morning

Morning! 
*   Can't believe you remember my mornings when there's not even sunrises in hell.
-   it seems pretty important to you. 
*   Why do you say that?
-   Well you text me about it every 23 or so hours. 
-   Texting the same thing that much, it must be pretty important. 
*   Am I texting you too much…
-   Are your thumbs hurting??? 
*   No? ->
-   Then don’t overthink it. I like you, it’s fine. 
*   You like me?
-   Don't overthink it.
