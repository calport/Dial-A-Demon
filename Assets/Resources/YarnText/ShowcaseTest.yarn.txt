Hey.
So, welcome to my game.
Can I ask...
Why you would play such a very dumb game?
To summon me???

mmmmmmmmmm
a thrill seeker
maybe our little bird here is a bit destructive.
maybe our little bird needs someone to be a bit more possessive...
;)
->Who are you?
    hahah
    maybe a better question is what am I?
    but you invited me here
    did you just think I wouldn't come?

    ->Look I'm just here to have fun
        Well you happened to summon the right demon

Well that's scary- I always thought I was quite real!
If I'm wrong though, what's stopping you from just erasing me away?

My silly bird, your voice was so quiet. Were you nervous?
->I'm not scared of you
    I'm sure you'll get a bit louder when we get to know each other more.
    Now, I have a reward for you.

You mumbled through the pronunciation a bit when summoning me.
but it was kinda cute.
Practice typing it a few more times.
