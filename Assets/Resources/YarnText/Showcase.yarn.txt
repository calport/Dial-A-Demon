Hey.
So, welcome to my game.
Can I ask...
Why you would play such a very dumb game?
To summon me???

Well that’s scary - I always thought I was quite real! 
If I’m wrong though, what’s stopping you from just erasing me away?
->Boredom. But no promises that I won’t erase you later…
    Ah, a challenge - I’ll have to impress you to keep you around.
    So, little believer, you must be pretty special if you’re the one my ritual chose to contact. Do you practice rituals?
    ->This is my first time.
        Hmmm. Must be another type of power...I look forward to finding out what it is
        If this is your “first time” we should make it official, right? Make a celebration out of it!
        I’ve got an idea, do you trust me?
        ->Not at all! I just told you I think you’re fake!
            Very good, you’re wise to not trust a demon. Even a false one.
            But at the least let me entertain you, it’s nothing scary I promise. It’ll be for the both of us.
            ->Sure, I’ll bite.
                I’ll take the “sure” but a bite would be moving things a little fast, don’t you think ;)
                Sign this contract with that name of yours and our bond will be even stronger. I can be here to bother you out of boredom for a bit longer
            ->I’m afraid to say yes
                Aw, don’t be. 
                That protection circle you drew keeps me from being with you in any form outside of this. 
                ->What if I want you outside of this phone
                    <<set $PlayerNickname = "demon">>
                    Well well well, who’s the real demon here? 
                    You may not yet feel me, but I’m embarrassed to say I can feel you. That little circle is bound right to my skin. I can feel every time you touch…
                    Anyway, enough with distraction. We should sign this contract together so I can bother you out of boredom for a bit longer
                    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
                ->That seems good
                    It is, who knows what you’d do to me if I wasn’t relegated to these hells.
                    Anyway, now that you feel safe chit chatting with a demon, here is the official contract to let me continue bothering you out of boredom:
                    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
            ->I guess, I’ve got nothing to lose.
                You’re a brave one, especially for a first time too. I like that.
                Let me test that trust, I want you to sign a contract with me.
                ->Ok, I’ll do it
                    No questions. What darkness resides in you, making you so reckless with a demon? I’d be worried if it wasn’t so harmless in this case. 
                    In any case, here it is.
                    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
                ->A contract?
                    Yeah we use contracts here, and rely on consenting guidelines for all our earthly summons.
                    It’s very common, just a little signature.
                    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
    ->You’re the third demon I summoned today.
        Someone’s a little demon themselves.
	    I haven’t talked to someone insatiable in quite some time. 
        ->How many people have summoned you today? 
            Demon’s never text and tell. ;)
            Besides I’m sure you summoned me, Dantalian on purpose. 
            ->You were my only option. 
                Then fate has already tied us together. 
                Do you want to bind us together more? 
                ->I want to do the tying
                    I like the initiative, maybe after we lay some groundwork? 
                    There’s a little something you’ll have to glance over before talking with me more. 
                    Hold on give me a minute to dig it up.
                ->You can do the tying
                    Well at least you know what you want!
                    Maybe after we lay some groundwork? 
                    There’s a little something you’ll have to glance over before talking with me more. 
                    Hold on give me a minute to dig it up.
        ->Let’s see if you can keep me entertained. 
            Is today the day that heaven freezes over? 
			I never thought a mortal would so teasing me. 
			Fine, I’ll succumb to your whims.
			I have an idea, do you trust me? 
            ->Sure, I’ll bite.
                I’ll take the “sure” but a bite would be moving things a little fast, don’t you think ;)
                Sign this contract with that name of yours and our bond will be even stronger. I can be here to bother you out of boredom for a bit longer

You’re a quick one, huh? :P
I’d give you a gold star, but all I have are some lollipops
And besides, you barely remember who you’ve summoned.
I was kinda expecting complete subservience and total admiration
->All you had to do was ask
    Then I’m not asking anymore!
    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
-> I think you should serve me
    Binding myself to you…

My bird, I am Dantalian, of Hell itself. Trust me, you don’t want me out ;)
->That excites me even more!
    I’d like that, but maybe that’s moving a little fast.
    Why don’t you bind yourself to me first?

Dantalian.
You mumbled through the pronunciation a bit, but it was a quite charming.
Practice typing it a few more times.
    ->Dantalian
        ->Dantalian
            Good bird.
            Now, I have a reward for you

My silly bird, your voice was so quiet. Were you nervous?
->i’m not scared of you
    I’m sure you’ll get a bit louder when we get to know each other more.
    Now, I have a reward for you.
    <<set $PlayerContract = 1>> 
->yes
    Awww I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable
    Sometimes summonings can be intense, but remember you’re always safe in your circle.
    -> my circle?
        Remember that little circle you drew when you logged in?
        Unlucky for you, it stops me from being with you in any form outside of this.

We haven't even done introductions.

                It takes some time for me to learn all your preferences.

little bird you don't even know who I am.
shouldn't you ask some simple questions before signing your soul to me?
->ok fair, so who are you?
    …
    You invited me here
    You called my name…
    ->i didn’t realize that was your name...
